The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile automatic rain wiper without driver interaction. The system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving.The system contains a controller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals The aim of this project is to help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is switching on and off the wiper. In rainy days we suffer from act of sprinkling of water on front glass of our wheeler. While driving car, driver cannot see on road vehicles. So he tries operating wiper on glass, for that he should often switch on for operating wiper and because of this it might cause vehicle accident.If we apply any kind of sensor on glass which senses the act of sprinkling water, by automation the wiper will be operating automatically. When the water hit the sensor, it will send signal to the system thus moving the wiper motor. Once the sensor did not detect any water, the wiper will stop. This will reduce the weaknesses which have been stated at beginning.
